# ChatGPT Replica

## Project Overview

ChatGPT Replica is a simple web application that mimics the interface of the popular ChatGPT model by OpenAI. The application allows users to interact with the chat interface, and it is built with a responsive design using Tailwind CSS. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience for messaging and instant communication.
